    <p>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</p>
    <p>by Maya Angelou</p>
          <br><p>A &nbsp; free &nbsp; bird &nbsp; leaps &nbsp; on &nbsp; the &nbsp; back</p>
          <p>Of &nbsp; the &nbsp; wind &nbsp; and &nbsp; floats &nbsp; downstream</p>
          <p>Till &nbsp; the &nbsp; current &nbsp; ends &nbsp; and &nbsp; dips &nbsp; his &nbsp; wing</p>
          <p>In &nbsp; the &nbsp; orange &nbsp; suns &nbsp; rays</p>
          <p>And &nbsp; dares &nbsp; to &nbsp; claim &nbsp; the &nbsp; sky.</p>
          <br><p>But &nbsp; a &nbsp; BIRD &nbsp; that &nbsp; stalks &nbsp; down &nbsp; his &nbsp; narrow &nbsp; cage</p>
          <p>Can &nbsp; seldom &nbsp; see &nbsp; through &nbsp; his &nbsp; bars &nbsp; of &nbsp; rage</p>
          <p>His &nbsp; wings &nbsp; are &nbsp; clipped &nbsp; and &nbsp; his &nbsp; feet &nbsp; are &nbsp; tied</p>
          <p>So &nbsp; he &nbsp; opens &nbsp; his &nbsp; throat &nbsp; to &nbsp; sing.</p>
          <br><p>The &nbsp; caged &nbsp; bird &nbsp; sings &nbsp; with &nbsp; a &nbsp; fearful &nbsp; trill</p>
          <p>Of &nbsp; things &nbsp; unknown &nbsp; but &nbsp; longed &nbsp; for &nbsp; still</p>
          <p>And &nbsp; his &nbsp; tune &nbsp; is &nbsp; heard &nbsp; on &nbsp; the &nbsp; distant &nbsp; hill &nbsp; for</p>
          <p>The &nbsp; caged &nbsp; birdsings &nbsp; of &nbsp;freedom.</p>
          <br><p>The &nbsp;free &nbsp;bird &nbsp;thinks &nbsp;of &nbsp;another&nbsp; breeze</p>
          <p>And &nbsp;the&nbsp; trade &nbsp;winds &nbsp;soft&nbsp; through</p>
          <p>The &nbsp;sighing&nbsp; trees</p>
          <p>And &nbsp;the &nbsp;fat &nbsp;worms &nbsp;waiting &nbsp;on &nbsp;a &nbsp;dawn-bright</p>
          <p>Lawn &nbsp;and &nbsp;he &nbsp;names&nbsp; the&nbsp; sky &nbsp;his&nbsp; own</p>
          <br><p>But&nbsp; a &nbsp;caged &nbsp;BIRD &nbsp;stands &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;grave &nbsp;of &nbsp;dreams</p>
          <p>His&nbsp; shadow &nbsp;shouts &nbsp;on&nbsp; a &nbsp;nightmare&nbsp; scream</p>
          <p>His &nbsp;wings&nbsp; are &nbsp;clipped &nbsp;and &nbsp;his&nbsp; feet &nbsp;are &nbsp;tied</p>
          <p>So &nbsp;he &nbsp;opens &nbsp;his &nbsp;throat&nbsp; to &nbsp;sing.</p>
          <br><p>The &nbsp;caged &nbsp;bird &nbsp;sings&nbsp; with</p>
          <p>A &nbsp;fearful &nbsp;trill &nbsp;of &nbsp;things &nbsp;unknown</p>
          <p>But&nbsp; longed&nbsp; for &nbsp;still &nbsp;and &nbsp;his</p>
          <p>Tune &nbsp;is&nbsp; heard &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;distant &nbsp;hill</p>
          <p>For&nbsp; the &nbsp;caged &nbsp;bird &nbsp;sings&nbsp; of &nbsp;freedom.</p>
