    <p>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</p>
    <p>by Maya Angelou</p>
          <p>A free bird leaps on the back</p>
          <p>Of the wind and floats downstream</p>
          <p>Till the current ends and dips his wing</p>
          <p>In the orange suns rays</p>
          <p>And dares to claim the sky.</p>
          <p>  But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage</p>
          <p>Can seldom see through his bars of rage</p>
          <p>His wings are clipped and his feet are tied</p>
          <p>So he opens his throat to sing.</p>
          <p>The caged bird sings with a fearful trill</p>
          <p>Of things unknown but longed for still</p>
          <p>And his tune is heard on the distant hill for</p>
          <p>The caged birdsings of freedom.</p>
          <p>The free bird thinks of another breeze</p>
          <p>And the trade winds soft through</p>
          <p>The sighing trees</p>
          <p>And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright</p>
          <p>Lawn and he names the sky his own</p>
          <p>But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams</p>
          <p>His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream</p>
          <p>His wings are clipped and his feet are tied</p>
          <p>So he opens his throat to sing.</p>
          <p>The caged bird sings with</p>
          <p>A fearful trill of things unknown</p>
          <p>But longed for still and his</p>
          <p>Tune is heard on the distant hill</p>
          <p>For the caged bird sings of freedom.</p>
